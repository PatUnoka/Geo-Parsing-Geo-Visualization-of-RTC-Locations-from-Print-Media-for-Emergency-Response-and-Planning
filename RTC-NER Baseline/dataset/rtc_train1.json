DAILY POST gathered that while eight persons were reportedly burnt to ashes on the spot following an explosion that followed the accident  four others later died on arrival at the Niger Delta Teaching Hospital in Okolobiri. The incident  which occurred at about 8pm Wednesday night involved a 14-seater passenger bus and a diesel tanker truck believed to be conveying chippings to a construction site around the Amassoma area.   Eyewitness accounts said the incident may have occurred because of the excessive speed by commercial road users of that particular route  adding that there are always deadly accidents on that road.      It was a terrible accident  we couldn’t even stand the sight of such flame; there was no way we could help out when the bus was burning. It was all tears  we can’t even assist out  no way to recognise any of them  there’s no means of identification because everything was burnt        The Bus and DIESEL tanker collided and the bus burst into flames  everybody in the bus was trapped and burnt beyond recognition except three survivors. The three survivors however later gave up the ghost     . Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) confirmed to DAILY POST that the burnt passengers were unrecognized and couldn’t immediately be identified    when we arrived at the scene at about 10pm there was nothing we could do     .   The FRSC officials confirmed that preliminary investigation showed that it was over speeding on the part of the diesel truck       we believe the truck driver removed the plate number and escaped from the scene of the accident. But the passenger bus plate number is VA6243      Also speaking  the spokesman of the Bayelsa State Police Command  Asinim Butswat  confirmed the incident and said the scene was gory and horrible                 \r\n                  One person has been confirmed dead in an accident involving a tanker vehicle and a 406 Peugeot car along Stadium Road by Uruaebot Market  Uyo  Akwa Ibom State. In a statement by FRSC Public Enlightenment Officer Paul James  the accident involved a tanker and a 406 Peugeot on Friday. According to his statement:   On Thursday  October 19  2023  a fatal crash occurred along Stadium Road by Uruaebot Market at about 10:40 am  involving a tanker with registration number MHA869XA and a 406 Peugeot with registration number CL775ABC.     The one person involved was confirmed dead and deposited at the hospital morgue. FRSC operatives arrived at the crash scene  having received a report of the incident.         The statement said that upon inquiry  it was discovered that overspeeding and inadequate display of caution signs were the causal factors in the crash. The Sector Commander of FRSC in Akwa Ibom State  Matthew Olonisaye  described the incident as unfortunate  saying that the crash could have been avoided if the people involved had adhered strictly to traffic rules and regulations guiding road usage.           \r\n                   The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned road users to abide by all the traffic regulations  especially during the ember months. FRSC zonal commander  ACM. Godwin Omiko gave the warning at the flag-off of The Ember Month campaign  held at the investment motor park in Dutse  Jigawa State. The theme of this year’s sensitisation is   Speed Thrills But Kills: Drive Responsibly and Avoid Overloading     .       Commander Omiko explained that ember months are characterized by heightened vehicular movement across Nigerian roads which results in the loss of lives and properties as a result of motor accidents. He said the FRSC has been intensifying efforts towards Road traffic crash reduction through a massive campaign against violation of traffic rules.   Over the years since inception  the Federal Road Safety Corps has been ahead on public education and proper use of the road by sensitizing the general public on maintaining good road use ethics in Nigeria        Road traffic crashes have been a menace to the most productive ages in our society with attendant losses in the country’s GDP of 5%      He explained that overspeeding and overloading are the major factors causing accidents in Nigeria.   Overspeeding causes the driver not to have firm control over the vehicle while in motion thereby increasing the risk of being involved in a traffic crash while Overloading creates an imbalance on the vehicle when in motion and this exerts maximum pressure on the vehicle tires      He advised road users to observe and abide by traffic rules and regulations to achieve a hitch-free Ember Months.          \r\n                   One person died  and two others sustained injuries in an accident along the Ota-Idiroko road in Ogun State on Wednesday. The crash  DAILY POST learnt  occurred around the Iju River bridge at about 07:20 a.m. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) confirmed that it involved an Iveco truck with registration number AAA969ZY  a Ford mini truck marked BDG340XZ and an unregistered Man Diesel truck.       Florence Okpe  the FRSC spokesperson in Ogun  said eight male adults were involved  adding that   two persons were injured and one person was killed from the multiple crash  while the remaining five were unhurt.      Okpe disclosed that the injured victims had been taken to Ota General Hospital for medical attention  while the corpse was deposited at the morgue in Ifo General Hospital. The suspected cause of the multiple crashes  the FRSC said  was a mechanical deficiency on one of the vehicles. Meanwhile  the Sector Commander of the FRSC in Ogun  Anthony Uga  had advised motorists to always pay attention to their vehicles and correct any fault detected to avoid road crashes.          \r\n                  A commercial motorcycle rider  popularly called Okada rider  was killed in a crash involving a trailer in Ilorin  the Kwara State capital  on Saturday. The incident occurred along the Maraba-Zango highway in the Ilorin metropolis at about 2 pm. Ogidan Ade  the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC)  confirmed the incident to DAILY POST.   According to him  the accident occurred when the driver of the trailer tried to avoid hitting the Okada rider  who entered his lane at high speed.    Earlier reports claimed that the three passengers on the motorcycle were crushed to death in the accident. The FRSC sector commander dismissed the claim  saying only the Okada rider died in the accident  while two others were taken to the UNILORIN teaching hospital for medical treatment. He blamed the deceased for his recklessness  which he said was the cause of the avoidable accident.              \r\n                  A fatal auto crash on Tuesday evening claimed the lives of six travellers along the Akure/Owo highway near the Akure Airport in Ondo State. The accident occurred during a heavy downpour and involved a MAN diesel truck and a Toyota Sienna space bus with registration number FFN-310-PU. It was gathered that the crash  which took place in the vicinity of the Akure Airport  also left one person injured.

Commander Ezekiel SonAllah of the Ondo State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC)  who confirmed the accident  stated that at the time of the collision  there were eight individuals inside the two vehicles involved. Preliminary investigations conducted by the FRSC revealed that the accident was caused by overspeeding and an ill-advised overtaking manoeuvre. SonAllah stressed the importance of adhering to speed limits and proper overtaking procedures to prevent such tragic incidents.   Various items  including money and mobile phones  were found at the scene following the accident. The FRSC Commander disclosed that the items have since been handed over to the police operatives stationed at Ogbese in Akure North Local Council.   The six corpses have been deposited at the general hospital mortuary in Akure while obstruction has been cleared  and the vehicles  money  and phones have been handed over to the police       he added.           \r\n                   The Adamawa State Command of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 31 lives were lost to road accidents from January to July this year. The command also confirmed that 274 persons sustained different degrees of injuries in the road crashes within the period under review. Mr Yelwa Dio  FRSC’s Sector Commander in the State  disclosed this in an interview with NAN in Yola on Saturday.       According to Dio  during the period the command recorded 126 road crashes involving 548 people. He attributed major causes of the accidents to excessive speeding  overloading of persons and goods  wrongful overtaking and use of mobile phones while driving. The sector commander therefore advised drivers and other road users to always abide by traffic rules and regulations to avoid mishaps.   The drivers should understand that passengers have the right to reach their destination safely.   Passengers also should be able to talk to the drivers on the need to obey traffic rules and regulations at all times       he said.          \r\n                  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 4 387 people were killed in road traffic crashes across the 36 States and the FCT from January to June 2023. According to NAN  the Corps Public Education Officer  Assistant Corps Marshal  Mr Bisi Kazeem said this on Sunday in an interview. He explained that the accidents occurred due to night trips  untrained drivers  fatigue  route violation and other causes.   He frowned at the inability of drivers in Nigeria to meet up with basic standards before hitting the road.    As a solution  he added that FRSC was engaging truck owners and drivers on the need for a functional onboard camera for round-the-clock monitoring of the activities.   From January to June  a total of 4 387 people were killed due to road traffic crashes. The Corps also recorded 14 108 injuries from the crashes within the same period       he said.           \r\n                   About four persons died  while 10 others sustained varying degrees of injuries in an accident involving two vehicles on Gumel-Kano Road in Jigawa.

He told NAN that the accident occurred at about 12:25 a.m. when a bus had a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle at Achauya village in Gumel Local Government Area of the state.         A commercial bus (Sharon) with registration number GML 260 XX carrying passengers was involved in a collision with a truck with registration number GUS 648 XA coming from the opposite direction.   It could be attributed to speed violation and loss of control  14 persons  consisting of 11 males and three females  were involved in the crash       he said. He said that four male passengers were certified dead by a medical doctor at a hospital in the area while seven other males and three females were receiving treatment. He advised motorists to shun night journeys and respect traffic rules to ensure safety on the road.          \r\n                  The Niger State Commander Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Mr Kumar Tsukwam  has disclosed that a total of 473 persons lost their lives in Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) between January and June 2023 in the state.

According to him    Within the period under review  the command recorded 766 road crashes  with about 5  272 persons involved  and 2  607 sustaining various degrees of injuries.      Also  204 of the road traffic crashes were fatal  483 serious  while 79 were minor.      The state Commander FRSC listed some of the causes of accidents  to include  human  vehicular and environmental factors. He  however  insisted that it is the human factor that is responsible for many of the accidents  adding that when the drivers obey traffic rules and regulations  they not only save their own lives  but those of other road users.   He noted that as a result of this  the corps usually concentrates on the drivers during its sensitisation  because little mistakes from them could lead to accidents being the ones driving and in control of the vehicles. Tsukwam maintained    Every day  we go to the motor parks to talk to commercial drivers and also take a look at their vehicles to determine their roadworthiness.      He then appealed to motorists to at all times respect traffic rules and regulations while using the roads to prevent accidents.           \r\n                  The Federal Road Safety Commission  FRSC  Osun Sector Command has confirmed that two bodies have been recovered by divers from a river in Eti-Oni.

Though  no life was lost to the incident as it was a lone accident  the commercial car involved was severely damaged after tumbling twice. An eyewitness said the five-passenger car which was occupied by both humans and luggage  encountered difficulty in ascending the makeshift road from Ilawe end  which led to the accident.   Road users and passers-by urged the state government to quickly fix the road to avert further road crashes  warning that the graded alternative currently in use would become impassable during the rainy season.    The driver of the vehicle  who was visibly angry  lamented how he would face challenges raising money to fix his car.

Just a few days ago  a car had a head-on collision with a tipper and all the passengers on board the car lost their lives to the crash.   I called on the state FRSC and other agencies responsible for traffic to ensure that henceforth  drivers arrested for recklessness should be prosecuted based on traffic laws.   I am worried about the way drivers are driving recklessly these days. No regard for traffic rules  no caution and no concern for other road users.   In the last one week  we have lost a number of lives through accidents caused by recklessness on the roads       he said.   As there will be an increased volume of traffic during this Yuletide  Habila admonished road users to always adhere strictly with traffic rules.   We appeal to road users to please observe and adhere to traffic rules  particularly in this festive season when traffic volume has increased       he advised.

It also advised all road users  whether drivers or motorcyclists to at all times comply with the prescribed speed limit as a way of ensuring safety on the road. The Osun Sector Commander  Kudirat Ibrahim gave the advice in a chat with DAILY POST on the heels of the accidents that occurred on the Gbongan-Ibadan road  Osogbo last week.       Mrs. Ibrahim  while advocating for the application of ‘common sense’ speed limit when driving urged road users to always slow down considerably whenever they are approaching a town  market or U-turn because other road users and pedestrians also avail themselves of the roads.   Since there are a lot of turns on the roads  there is the need to slow down on approach as this would also contribute in averting road traffic accidents and car crashes.   Most of these crashes are caused by excessive speeding and wrongful overtaking on the part of motorists.   The motoring public needs to work with the FRSC  federal and state governments to ensure that they don’t harm other people in the course of moving from one place to the other.      While calling on the public to accept the fact that road safety is everybody’s business  the Osun FRSC Sector Commander explained that the Commission has personnel in township roads controlling traffic.   We also go to the markets to discourage people from parking their cars on the road  but after we depart  they will disregard our directives.      She also maintained that the road users ought to take personal responsibility because excessive speeding by vehicles may cause more harm to the people.   There is no point in carrying out continuous reminders and the commission cannot do route lining from Gbongan to Osogbo. We are always sensitising on the need to reduce their speed limit and slow down to soothe the conditions of the roads because there are junctions and markets located on this stretch of road from Gbongan to Osogbo. DAILY POST had reported last week accidents that occurred on the Gbongan-Ibadan road at Ogo-Oluwa where a woman roasting plantain was killed by the roadside and at Owode-Ede  where a man was seriously injured by an 18 seater bus.

He called for the review of the highway codes to ensure stiffer penalties for road traffic offenders. Amaechi spoke in Abuja on Thursday at the Easter mega rally organised by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC).   Amaechi assured that the ministry and the FRSC would work together to ensure that the laws were reviewed.    He said when this is done  those who overload their vehicle  drive while drunk or drive recklessly  will be more careful.   Most accidents you see today are not caused by bad roads but the recklessness of the drivers on the roads.   I want to urge all drivers to be cautious of not just them but the passengers they carry. Safety is paramount.        Corps Marshal  FRSC  Dr Boboye Oyeyemi  said the major problem the corps was facing was crashes at night  adding that 200 lives were lost in January 2021.           \r\n                   The Osun State Government has described the death of popular radio presenter of Unique FM Ilesa  Sunday Alakinde  as shocking and unbelievable.

On behalf of the governor of Osun State  Gboyega Oyetola  the government and entire good people of Osun State  please accept my heartfelt condolences     .   May God grant the management and staff of your station and in particular The Alakinde family the fortitude to bear the great loss      Concludes Egbemode.           \r\n                  Kaduna State Government on Monday said 19 road travellers died while 34 others sustained injuries during an accident along Kaduna-Abuja road.

Mr Okoro Eweka  the State Commandant  through the command’s Public Relations Officer (PRO)  ASC. Olufemi Omole confirmed the incident to newsmen on Saturday  NAN reports. Eweka said that it was a moment of sober reflection when the news of the demise of the two officers broke on Friday.       He also noted the need to intensify prayers for the NSCDC and all security agencies as this would attract God’s blessings and protection in the discharge of their duties.   I felt sad when hearing the news of the death of two personnel who died in a motor accident on Friday  Oct. 30  2020.   The personnel were involved in the accident when coming from Okitipupa where they had gone to join a colleague in the burial of his mother.   Unfortunately the six passengers’ space wagon car was said to have skipped off the road and somersaulted into a ditch       he said.

The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps  who confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Tuesday  said five others sustained injuries in the fatal crash. Babatunde Akinbiyi  the Ogun TRACE Corps Spokesperson  told DAILY POST that the accident occurred around 5:45pm on Monday.

The truck has been taken to Redeemed Police Station by TRACE and FRSC officials while the dead victim  including the Okada rider  have been taken to Fakoya Mortuary  Sagamu       he said. Meanwhile  the TRACE Corps has appealed to   motorists and motorcyclists to avoid driving in a direction prohibited by traffic (One-Way) particularly on an expressway due to its attendant risk.                \r\n                   Motorists in Bauchi State have been admonished to ensure that their vehicles are always in good conditions to avert road crashes. The state Director Motor Vehicle Administration  Engineer Kabiru Hussein  gave the admonition at a joint 2020 Ember months enlightenment campaign organised by the Nigeria Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN)  held at the Bauchi Central Motor Park. According to him  the admonition should be taken seriously by drivers in view of the fact that cases of accidents are on the increase in recent times.       He stated that accidents do occur mostly due to human factors  including over speeding  reckless driving  lack of proper maintenance of vehicles  overloading  among others. Hussein said many lives are lost to accidents not only in Bauchi State but also across Nigeria as a result of accidents.   Accidents occur on daily basis across the country and Bauchi State is not an exception. As a result  many lives have been lost       he said. The ember months campaign  he said  is organised with a view to enlightening motorists  particularly commercial drivers on the need to obey traffic regulations.   We organised this ember months enlightenment campaign to educate motorists  particularly commercial drivers to adhere to traffic rules and regulations.   Accidents can be avoided if only we obey the traffic rules. Thus  we must do everything within our power as road users to limit the rate of crashes on our road  especially now that the ember months are around the corner       he said. He further called on drivers to avoid overspeeding as well as reckless driving not only during the ember months but always. ‘Driving recklessly is another leading cause of accidents on our highways. We must avoid this as drivers to save lives       he advised. In their separate remarks  the state chairman of the NURTW  Ismaila Abubakar and his RTEAN counterpart  Abdullahi Mohammed  called on the Bauchi State government to provide operational vehicles to the two transport unions in all the 20 local government areas of the state to enhance their operations.           \r\n                   I have had the good fortune of being driven around in very extensive journeys in both the United Kingdom and China. In China  around year 2005  I can recall an experience I had to be conveyed in a bus from the political capital of that vast Country to another far distant province in a journey that spanned eight hours. The roads were well laid and greatly maintained from the Chinese beautiful capital city to that part of China. The journey was an adventure in sweet discoveries and the roads were so well built that there was not a single bump.       However  a noticeable incident is the absence of any sort of stop and search armed police nor did we experience any incident of road terrorism such as armed banditry  armed kidnapping and or harassment by armed security forces. In Great Britain  about a couple of years back  the journey from Central London to a beach very close to the border with France was sweet and there was never any incident of road terrorism even as it was a beautiful journey just as I enumerated above in my other journeys in China. Also  the nations of China and the United Kingdom have seamless road transportation systems and strategies for checking cases of terrorism and insecurity of any kinds on their highways just as the enforcement of traffic laws are scientifically based and fantastically implemented. When cases of crimes or terrorism on the road do occur which are very rare  It is a known fact that those involved in such incidents are apprehended and prosecuted just as they are made to face the full weight of the laws and therefore the concept of road safety in those jurisdictions are integral and strategic even as the matter of road maintenance are second to none. I’m not sure I saw the equivalence of Nigeria’s federal highway policing institution. In the UK  the Police still enforce traffic laws using the best available technology and CCTV. The same can’t be said about Nigeria where I have had the misfortune to have travelled to the entire 36 years spanning a period of three decades. To be fair to history  in Nigeria of the 1980’s  road travels had minimal violent incidents just as the standards of roads maintenance are high and this was the period the Country had only the Nigerian Police Force as the enforcers of traffic laws and there were almost non-existing terrorists on the highways of Nigeria. However  Nigeria now has a road safety commission set up under the · FEDERAL ROAD SAFETY COMMISSION (ESTABLISHMENT) ACT  2007 2007 ACT No. 22 which is an extant ACT TO REPEAL THE FEDERAL ROAD SAFETY COMMISSION ACT  CAP 141 LFN  1990 (AS AMENDED) TO ESTABLISH THE FEDERAL ROAD SAFETY COMMISSION WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PREVENTING AND MINIMIZING ACCIDENTS ON THE HIGHWAYS  THE SUPERVISION OF USERS OF SUCH HIGHWAYS  THE REGULATION OF TRAFFIC THEREON AND CLEARING OF OBSTRUCTION ON ANY PART OF THE HIGHWAYS AND FOR EDUCATING DRIVERS  MOTORISTS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC GENERALLY ON THE PROPER USE OF HIGHWAYS; AND FOR RELATED MATTERS TO SAFETY ON THE HIGHWAYS. Specifically  the chapter 5 of the law says ;The Commission may make regulations generally for the carrying out of the (m) the supervision of the user of highways; (n) the restriction or exclusion of type or class of vehicles;(o) the restriction of the use of highway by any breed of animals; (p) the line to be kept on a highway and the direction to be followed by vehicles. Since over a decade that this Commission was set up   there has been a mixed bag of opinion on their performance given that deaths from accidents have increased and the most dominant causative factor is the deteriorating state of the road infrastructures all over Nigeria. Infact the Corp marshal of the Federal Road Safety commission was quoted recently in the media of claiming that road accident kills more than the much dreaded global pandemic of COVID-19. Suffice it to state that there have been calls for the federal Road safety commission to be further empowered to effectively enforce sanity on our high ways. For unstance  the President  Court of Appeal Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem  recently disclosed that there were no stringent laws to punish road traffic offenders in the country. Justice Dongban-Mensem  who made the remarks during the 9th annual road safety conference and FRSC/KRSD easy competition award 2020  held at ICT hall of Federal Road Safety Corps  FRSC  headquarters in Abuja  regretted the absence of severe punishment accounted for reckless and dangerous driving often result in death or injury. Justice Dongban-Mensem spoke at the event to mark the 10th memorial of the passing of her son  Prince Kwapda’as Rangna’an Samson Dongban  who was killed by unknown motorist in Jos  plateau State and in whose memory the Kwapda’as Road Safety Demand  KRSD Foundation was established. She said    We have set aside this day for annual conference to remember him and several others who have departed this world in similar circumstance and place at the front burner of public discourse the unabating road crash incidences in our country.    According to her    It’s my conviction that the penalties currently listed in our laws are no longer as stringent as they were when first enacted. On the contrary  the grievous acts of over speeding  reckless or dangerous driving often result in death or injury. It appears as though  drivers found guilty of road offences are given a proverbial slap on the wrist   We shall continually embark on fresh initiatives so as to change this anomaly. Now  we are in the process of sponsoring a Bill in National Assembly. The Bill entitled ‘Proposal to the National Assembly for the amendment and addition of some Sections to the Federal Road Safety Commission Act 2007’.   This amendment seeks to impose stringent penalties are meted to traffic offenders. This should ensure that errant drivers are effectively precluded from reckless behavior on our roads or otherwise adequately punished for it. The idea is to implore deterrence.      The respected jurist stressed further that    Also  we are reviewing the provisions on Third Party Motor Insurance Policy. In Nigeria  third party insurance is compulsory under the Motor Vehicle (Third Party) Insurance Act 1950.   It is one of the six compulsory classes of insurance under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. However  this policy stops at coercing motorists to buy the stickers. Motorists pay the annual premium of N5  000 and it stops there.   Actually  the policy is designed to make insurance companies pay compensation to road crash victims in form of restitution. It is meant to help the injured recover medical bills or relatives of the dead get compensations.   However  we hear stories like Fake Insurance Companies collecting premiums  insurers adopting very frustratingly complex indemnity processes etc.   Almost every vehicle on the road is covered with either Comprehensive or Third Party Motor Insurance policy. Yet victims of motor crashes hardly get compensated in Nigeria  thereby making the policy very unpopular in Nigeria.   We would like to enlighten motorists and the general public on the benefits of the Third Party Motor Insurance Policy to ensure that the process of identification is seamless and transparent.   We want to see a straightforward and fraud proof way of acquiring the insurance sticker. This has worked in a country like Uganda. It should work here also.   I wish to remind us in ending my speech that the commitment to safer roads is for all Nigerians. The FRSC  Special Marshals and the Regular Marshals cannot do it alone.   I urge all Nigerians to join us in making a personal commitment to Keep the Roads Safe by not drinking and driving  not over speed  wearing your seatbelts and helmets  observing the traffic rules and encouraging fellow drivers to obey traffic rules.   That way  the loss of the lives of my son and all those who have passed  will never be in vain. Above all  I urge everyone to make a commitment to stop and save a road crash victim and please do not look away.      Noble and wonderful as these calls for upgrade of the legal frameworks setting up the Roads safety commission are  but the biggest challenge to the safety of commuters is not being looked at which is the all important grave threat posed by kidnappers and bandits on the highways. The critical postulation is to ask the Nigerian government why it does not think that it has the legal obligations to enforce the counter terror law effectively on the highways to stop the incessant attacks  kidnappings and maiming of commuters and users of these highways. Why check the road worthiness of vehicles plying our roads but fail to fix the rapidly deteriorating federal road infrastructures and the increasing threats to the lives and property of commuters on the highways? This reflection is to challenge the Federal Republic of Nigeria to amend the Federal Road Safety COMMISSION’s law to blend it with relevant sections of the nation’s counter terrorism laws so it becomes inherently incumbent on a joint patrol of men and operatives of Federal Road Safety COMMISSION and the trained wing of the armed security forces to continuously clampdown on TERRORISTS ON NIGERIAN HIGHWAYS. Just the past five Months  not less than 500 Nigerian commuters on these Highways have been killed or kidnapped by terrorists. Recently  no fewer than two passengers were killed  while a police officer was shot at a nearby roadblock by suspected armed robbers on Okene -Lokoja highway in Kogi State. The incident  which occurred at about 6p.m. at Osara last led to most of the drivers abandoning their vehicles and running away while the passengers were left stranded on the road. Also  a report by Daily Nigerian indicates that armed men suspected to be kidnappers on Thursday  July 30  returned to Abuja-Kaduna expressway and abducted an unspecified number of travellers. The incident happened as many Muslim faithfuls travel to spend time with their loved ones for the Sallah festivities. Around July  a Nigeria army captain attached to the 353 Artillery Regiment  Ojo  Lagos  was shot dead by men suspected to be armed bandits or kidnappers. GSM Abubakar  with army number N/13600  was traveling in his Honda Accord car when he ran into a blockade mounted by the armed men along the notorious Okene -Lokoja highway  those familiar with the matter said. Mr Abubakar  media sources said  was traveling from Lagos to the Armed Forces Command and Staff College  Jaji  to participate in this year’s junior officers course. In less than five days that an Army Captain was killed along Abuja- lokoja- Okene highway by men suspected to be armed robbers/ kidnappers two other naval officers were also killed on Thursday evening. The two officers one Male and the other female were said to have been shot dead at about 6pm while driving in their personal vehicle along the now dreaded area of the highway This is coming six days after an army captain GSM Abubakar was also killed on the same road while his mother and wife were reportedly kidnapped. Around May  it was an unusual onslaught of attacks for Lagos residents by highway robbers in recent days  who have taken advantage of the traffic snarl caused by road construction workers and tanker drivers along several sections of the Oshodi-Apapa expressway. In June  four persons narrowly escaped death  as hoodlum suspected to be armed robbers with automatic pump action rifle fired indiscriminately after allegedly snatching a bag containing the sum of N3 500 000 cash from one Mr Ebuka Ukeakpu  at Regina Ceali junction by Zenith Bank PLC along Enugu-Onitsha Expressway  Awka  Anambra State. Then in July a yet to be specified number of travellers were allegedly abducted along Abuja- Kaduna Expressway on Thursday by some hoodlums. SaharaReporters gathered that the gunmen laid ambush near Katari Village  shooting sporadically at some vehicles heading to Kaduna around 9:00am. Another media observer told the story thus:   An unspecified number of people are said to have been abducted on the Kaduna-Abuja highway. The incident  according one of the victims  the driver of The Sun Newspapers circulation van  Mallam Ibrahim  occurred in the early hours of thursday. He said the incident took place close to the popular Alheri Camp  a few kilometres to the Kaduna metropolis.

Oyeyemi stated this in his 2020 new year message in which he applauded the critical road safety stakeholders for sustaining the tempo of campaigns in the outgoing year with call on them not to relent in the new year. According to the press release signed by the FRSC Public Education Officer  Bisi Kazeem  the Corps Marshal expressed appreciation to the stakeholders for joining hands with the Corps in efforts to create safety consciousness among road users and living up to the expectation of making road safety a collective responsibility of all.       This he said  remains the best guarantee to safeguarding public safety and creating safer road environment in the country. Oyeyemi called for more efforts in the coming year to consolidate on the gains of the campaigns in the outgoing year in order to restore sanity on the nation’s roads. He reiterated the importance of 2020 in ongoing global campaign for road safety  noting that as the last year before the evaluation of the success of the decade long campaigns for road safety  set under the auspices of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety: 2011-2020  its success is very critical. The FRSC boss  therefore  urged every Nigerian to remain committed to the ideals of the campaign for the nation to stand out in the evaluation of the success of the campaign in the subsequent year.   Nigeria was one of the member nations of the UN to activate the global road safety campaign when it was first launched in 2010. Since then  the nation has remained active in its campaigns through increased investment in road safety management and all the pillars of the campaign  which must be sustained for us to gain favourable rating in the measurement of our success story       the Corps Marshal stated.   I therefore  urged all relevant stakeholders and members of the public not to relent their efforts in the coming year  for Nigeria to stand out among the comity of nations that participated actively in the campaign       he added.

He added that all the FRSC rescue facilities as well media platforms including the call centre would remain open and alert to serve members of the public during the celebration and beyond.   For the avoidance of doubt  members of the public should not hesitate to report road traffic crashes  obstruction or other emergencies to the FRSC Toll Free line: 122 and tune into the National Traffic Radio on107.1FM Abuja with the studio numbers: 09067000015 and 08052998090 respectively       he disclosed. He further stressed that road safety is no accident  but concerted efforts made by road users to obey traffic rules and regulations and guide against what could be prevented.   Everyone must therefore drive to save a life and with the consciousness of one waiting to get home safely to meet his waiting family       the FRSC boss further stated. It would be recalled that as part of the counter measures against the menace of road traffic crashes during Yuletide season with heightened traffic movements across the country  the FRSC instituted the yearly special end of year operations launched at the beginning of September to cover the ember months.

Suleiman called on drivers to change their attitude towards driving and obey road traffic regulations in order to reduce the loss of lives from accidents.   What we are saying is this  they need to change their attitude towards driving because most of the crashes that are now happening are as a result of refusal to obey simple rules and regulations while driving.   Imagine this accident that had just happened  the driver could have waited for a few seconds for the oncoming vehicle to pass before overtaking the one in front of him  but look at what happened  because he refused to wait.   So  I call on them to be law abiding and fear God Almighty and have respect for lives       Suleiman pleaded.           \r\n                   The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) has reiterated its commitment towards collaborating with traditional rulers to intensify efforts aimed at reducing auto crashes The commitment was made by the Zonal Commanding officer  Bauchi Zone Rs. 12  ACM  Imoh J.

DAILY POST recalls that a van of FRSC collided with the taxi when the FRSC were chasing the taxi driver alleged to have violated traffic offence. It was gathered that many people escaped death when FRSC officials engaged the Micra driver in a hot chase  resulting in the death of one person with others sustaining injuries. The FRSC van marked 1139 (3) and the Micra car with number plate Lagos 831 DH were badly damaged as they both plunged into a deep ditch.       An eyewitness stated that    We saw how the FRSC officials were pursuing the unpainted commercial car. The officials were trying to overtake the car and in the process both of them plunged into this wide hole by the roadside. We were told that the FRSC were chasing the car because it was not painted the normal commercial colour. The passengers in the car were shouting and pleading with the officials not to risk their lives  but they did not heed their pleas.   Like a movie  we just saw and heard a deafening noise after they crashed. The Micra car summersaulted before it crashed into the ditch followed by the FRSC van. The driver of the Micra car had stopped breathing by the time they carried him. Other four passengers in the car were critically injured when they pulled them out. Blood covered them all over.      However  the police and the FRSC have different record of what happened. While the police command  Friday evening confirmed the death of one person  the state sector command of FRSC said on Saturday that nobody died in the accident which occurred on Friday. Police spokesman  Olugbenga Fadeyi  on Friday told journalists that    The incident happened in Akinyele Local Government. We gathered they had collision and both plunged into a ditch.   One person  as at the time when the matter was reported  was confirmed dead.   The hoodlums later attempted to seize the opportunity to foment trouble but the timely intervention of the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of operations  nipped the matter in the bud     . But  the State Command of the FRSC insisted that no life was lost in the incident. FRSC Corps Education Officer  Seun Onijala  maintained that three persons were injured  while the remaining three persons were unhurt. Onijala said    Nobody died in the accident and I am telling you the true picture of what happened.   The officials asked the Micra car to stop and the driver refused to do so and decided to turn the wheel of the car to the officials at the right and left side of the road with the aim of knocking them down.   The FRSC officials were able to move away to the other side of road and the driver of the Micra car moved on and the patrol team van gave the Micra car a chase. In the process of the chase  a trailer was coming on the one way of the road and the option for the Micra car and the FRSC Van was either to both had an head-on-collision with the trailer or fall into the wide hole by the roadside.               \r\n                  A road accident involving a truck loaded with cement and a tipper at Ibughubu Market  Umuchu  in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State has claimed six lives.

An eyewitness told DAILY POST that the truck damaged over three shops at the market  including the wares in it.    Mr. Joshua Agbasiri who claimed to witness the accident said both trucks had a head-on collusion  while the impact caused them to veer into the market.   The cement truck was on a high speed. It pushed the tipper to the other side of the market where it destroyed shops and inflicted injuries on some shop owners       he said.

To set the record straight  a total of nine persons lost their lives in the mishap with seven being members and supporters of the PDP and two occupants of the ill-fated Sienna.   This is to correct the negative impression in the media that over 30 persons died in the auto crash. This is untrue and misleading.   We know every life matters and we are pained over the sad development; but we want to urge the general public to disregard the report making the rounds on the social mediashpere on the casualty figure.   Comrade Abba Moro  who was in his Otukpo residence when the incident occurred  received the news with shock and disbelief. He quickly rushed down to the scene with his team to ascertain the situation. This is contrary to the report that he was part of the convoy.   He subsequently moved to the hospital with senior members of the party where survivors were being rushed to before proceeding to the venue in Obagaji  Agatu to officially call off the rally as a mark of honour.   Comrade Abba Moro is really sad about the mishap as one can obviously attribute the luciferous incident to the high traffic due to the Yuletide  which might have engineered the head-on collision.      Below are the confirmed names of our supporters who could not make it. 1. Dr. Ulaka Ulaka 2. Agi Ukuru Agu 3. Abigial Ogo 4. Odo Enyi 5. John Billy 6. Akpede Egbe 7. Ogbaji Onda. While praying God to give the bereaved families the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss  Moro wished the survivors speedy recovery.           \r\n                   The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said two persons were killed while two others were injured in an accident involving two vehicles around Animashaun Estate on Idi Iroko road in Ogun on Saturday.

The campaign  which commenced on Tuesday at the police officers’ mess in Asaba  was in collaboration with the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC)  Delta State Management Agency (DESTMA)  and other sister security agencies. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday in Asaba  the Commissioner of Police  Mustafa Muhammed said the campaign theme:   Say No To Avoidable Death       was apt to reduce the carnage occasioned by road accidents  stressing that beyond the efforts of the police to educate the public  measure will be taken to enforce sanctions according to the provisions of the law.       The police boss called on opinion leaders to utilize their position either as traditional rulers  clergymen or other positions to campaign against the menace  stressing that the first half of preventing road accidents lies with the police and sister agencies while the other half rests with the society. Earlier in his lecture  the Director-General of Delta State Traffic Management Agency (DESTMA)  Mr. Stephen Dieseruvwe  charged motorists and other road users to engage in defensive driving as against competitive driving  adding that human error is the most prevalent contributing factor which accounts for over 80 per cent of deaths on the roads.   Our roads are getting busier than previous times and they get busier in the yuletide season of every year. Associated with this busy roads  drivers have to cope with the unpredictable  irrational  competitive  offensive and dangerous driving attitudes of other drivers  which make our road conditions hostile  resulting in higher risks of accidents on our roads       he said. Other speakers who represented the Nigerian Army  the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC)  National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and other stakeholders  identified causes of road accidents and suggested ways to address the menace which has continued to threaten road users  even as statistics of traffic crashes in the state between January to June 2018 shows 262 occurrence with 78 fatal accidents and 114 serious motor accidents  with 65 killed. Some of the speakers lamented the careless attitude of drivers before embarking on a journey  noting that some of them do not check if their vehicles are road worthy  while others hit the road with elements of alcohol or other inducements which hamper their judgment and consciousness. There was the consensus that obeying simple traffic rules can help prevent avoidable deaths on the highway.           \r\n                  Three persons were on Thursday burnt to death and five others sustained injuries in an accident along Zariagi-Lokoja highway in Kogi State.

DAILY POST had last month reported that two persons among those conveying a corpse lost their lives in an accident that happened at Kwali along the ever-busy Abuja-Lokoja highway.

He lamented the delay in the completion of work  stressing that the project was causing sleepless nights  aside numerous accidents recorded particularly on the section of the highway. According to Mamman    There are so many accidents on this road and this is because of the delay in project execution. The staff left site since December last year and so it’s been giving us a lot of sleepless nights.      Asked by the Minister of what measure to take  he advised    The project should be terminated by the Federal Government.      For the past five months  they have not returned to site so we have no other alternative than to terminate the contract.        In his remarks  the firm Site Engineer  Mr. Peter Omenye attributed the delay to strike action from the workers  admitting that it was already five months since the workers commenced the union strike. He stressed that the firm had persuaded the union but they persisted on their position.           \r\n                  The Federal Road Safety Corps has confirmed that 41 people died while 287 were seriously injured in road accidents that occurred from January to date.

Mr Samuel Odukoya  the FRSC Sector Commander in the state  told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin that 10 deaths were recorded in April and 12 in May. He said that the total casualties involved in the RTCs within the period under review was 187  with 101 recorded in April and 86 in May.   The sector commander said that of the figure  165 persons were injured in the 44 RTCs that occurred across the state within the period.    He attributed the drop in RTCs in the state to commercial vehicle owners’ compliance with the directive to install speed limit device. The FRSC boss  however  said that it had come to the notice of the command that some commercial transport companies were readjusting the speed limit device installed in their vehicles.   We will soon clamp down on those transport companies ’’ he said.   Odukoya also said that the command was constantly sensitising motorists on the need to be careful and avoid reckless driving during the rainy season.

The sector commander said the ‘stressed’ articulated vehicle with registration number ENU69XY which was heading toward the Onitsha Bridgehead had a brake failure and rammed into several other vehicles on the road. He attributed the high number of casualty to the use of only a section of the Enugu – Onitsha expressway due to ongoing asphalting on the other section by the state government.   You will appreciate the fact that the proactive measure we took saved a lot of lives here today.   We have sensitised people on this axis against selling or parking along the road.   I want to make it clear that the solution to road carnage is positive attitude of people driving on our roads       Ajayi said. The sector commander said two commercial motorcycles  four commercial buses  a commercial tricycle  one RAV 4 SUV and a Toyota Hilux vehicles were involved in the multiple crashes.

He  therefore  reasoned that a functional rail system will reduce road carnages and the attendant loss of lives and property in the country.   Oyeyemi said this on Thursday in Abuja at a press briefing on the Sallah special patrol and the commencement of enforcement of speed limiting device in commercial vehicles.    He commended the Federal Government for investing in rail transport  noting that an improved inter-modal transport system across the country would assist the corps to achieve the UN Decade of Action goals.   I commend the government for reviving the rail transport in the country. Since the inauguration of the Abuja-Kaduna rail line  road traffic crashes has reduced along that corridor  as well as the usually dense traffic on that road.   If the rail transport and other inter-modal system are introduced in other parts of the country  it would help the FRSC to achieve its desired objectives of reducing road traffic crashes and fatalities       he said.   The FRSC boss maintained that the enforcement of the speed limiting device in commercial vehicles would commence on October 1  2016  adding that the facility was meant to reduce fatalities on the road and not to punish operators. He explained that the agency had succeeded in reducing road traffic crashes between January and August  2016 over the figures recorded in the same period in 2015.   From January to August  2015  a total of 5 953 crashes were recorded involving 39 119 people in which 3 233 of them died and 17 189 others were rescued alive. Comparatively  within the same period in 2016  a total of 5 707 crashes were recorded involving 38 222 people out of which 3 048 died and 17 446 others were rescued alive       Oyeyemi said.           \r\n                   The Zonal commanding officer  Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC)  in charge of Kaduna  Kano  Jigawa and Katsina states  Mr. Bulus Darwang has solicited for media support to properly educate Nigerians on road usage with a view to reducing roads accidents to the barest minimum. Speaking on Monday in Kaduna on a courtesy visit to the Nigeria Union of Journalists NUJ  Kaduna State chapter  he said that the rate of road accidents along Kaduna  Jigawa  Kano and Katsina highways was highly alarming.   To reduce the road accidents to the barest minimum  he noted    We need to step up efforts alongside public enlightenment and we cannot achieve this without the support of the press.         He maintained that speed limit violation was a major challenge the commission was facing nationwide  adding that    It has showed that 50 percent of road accidents across the Country is caused by over speeding.      Mr. Darwang also pointed out that tyre burst was another monster that has resulted in the death of many people in the country’s highways.   We lost six Ekiti Doctors who were on their way to Sokoto  Minister of State for Labor  Mr James Ocholi along Kaduna/ Abuja highway and students that died in a motor accident between Ibadan and Lagos.     It is for this reason that the FRSC in its wisdom declared a one week tyre safety campaign nationwide. We have gone to Jigawa  Kano  Katsina and Kaduna in order to enlighten Nigerians of what is expected of them towards ensuring safety on our highways.   We’ll sustain the campaign to the end of the year and beyond.      He disclosed that the commission had given them a standing order that there should not be any road accident along Abuja/ Kaduna highway for four days  stressing that it has been achieved. While responding  the Chairman of the NUJ Kaduna state Chapter  Comrade Garba Mohammed commended the FRSC for their partnership with NEMA to reduce the risk of road accidents especially in the ember months. He assured that the doors of the union are open for any collaboration to ensure public enlightenment in order to minimally reduce the incidence of road crashes across the country.
